User Stories
1. As a vanilla git power user that has never seen or used gigglegit before, I was to map my existing git knowledge to gigglegits interface so I can be productive. 
* Task: create git-to-gigglegit mapping interface
* Tickets: 
- Create details for command translation layer: develop a system that maps standard git commands to their gigglegit equivalents
- Build interactive tutorial: create an interactive interface that guides the users through gigglegits features while relating them to familiar git concepts 
2. As an experience GiggleGit user, I want to delegate appropriate permissons and access levels to ensure they can contribute effectively while maintaining project security. 
* Task: implement role-based access control 
- tickets: design permission hierarchy: design a permission system that allows control over repository access, meme usage, and merge capabilities
- Create access management dashboard: build an interface for team leads to manage user roles, view access histories, and modify permissions. 
3. As a developer working across multiple repositories, I want to quickly find and apply appropriate memes for my merge requests so I can maintain consistent communication cross-teams. 
* Task: create meme suggestion engine: 
* Tickets: 
- Implement meme tagging system: create a tagging system that categorizes memes based on merge context 
- Build merge context analyzer: develop an analyzer than examines the merge requests characteristics to suggest appropriate memes for the context. 

2. Formal Requirements
Goals: 
- Create a diff tool that allows users to express merge intent through customizable humorous elements while maintaining all standard diff functionality

Non goal: 
- Develop an AI system to automatically generate memes and other humorous content for diff 

Non-Functional Requirements: 
1. Study integrity 
* Functional requirements: 
- The system will automatically assign users to either control or change groups upon the first login with equal chance 
- The system will log all user interactions with memes and humorous elements without exposing group assignment to users or regular admin 
2. Content Governance: 
* Functional requirements: 
- The system will provide PM- specific interfaces for adding and changing humorous elements
- The system will maintain and audit log of all changes to the humor library with timestamp, author and approval chain.
